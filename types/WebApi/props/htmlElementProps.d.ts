   * header in the response, to register a
   * [navigation-based attribution source](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Registering_sources#navigation-based_attribution_sources)
   * .
   *
   * The browser stores the source data associated with the navigation-based

   * This specifies that you want the
   * [Attribution-Reporting-Eligible](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Eligible)
   * header sent to the same server as the href attribute points to.
   * This is fine when you are handling the attribution source
   * registration on the same server.

   * - Value containing one or more URLs, for example:
   * ```html
   * attributionsrc="https://a.example/register-source
   * https://b.example/register-source"
   * ```
   *
   * This is useful in cases where the requested resource is not on a server
   * you control, or you just want to handle registering the attribution source
   * on a different server. In this case, you can specify one or more URLs as
   * the value of `attributionsrc`. When the resource request occurs, the

   * [Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source)
   * to complete registration.

   * > **_NOTE:_**
   * Specifying multiple URLs means that multiple attribution sources can
   * be registered on the same feature. You might for example have different
   * campaigns that you are trying to measure the success of, which involve
   * generating different reports on different data.

   * trigger input validation, send data to a web server, or close a dialog.
   *
   * - `allow-modals`: Allows the page to open modal windows by

   * `Window.prompt()`, while opening a `<dialog>` is allowed
   * regardless of this keyword. It also allows the page to
   * receive `BeforeUnloadEvent` event.
   *
   * - `allow-orientation-lock`: Lets the resource lock the screen orientation.
   *
   * - `allow-pointer-lock`: Allows the page to use the Pointer Lock API.
   *
   * - `allow-popups`: Allows popups (like from `Window.open()`,
   * `target="_blank"`, `Window.showModalDialog()`).
   * If this keyword is not used, that functionality will silently fail.
   *
   * - `allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox`: Allows a sandboxed document to open
   * a new browsing context without forcing the sandboxing flags upon it.
   * This will allow, for example, a third-party advertisement to be safely
   * sandboxed without forcing the same restrictions upon the page the ad
   * links to. If this flag is not included, a redirected page, popup window,
   * or new tab will be subject to the same sandbox restrictions as the
   * originating `<iframe>`.
   *
   * - `allow-presentation`: Allows embedders to have control over whether
   * an iframe can start a presentation session.
   *
   * - `allow-same-origin`: If this token is not used, the resource is treated
   * as being from a special origin that always fails the same-origin policy
   * (potentially preventing access to data storage/cookies and some JavaScript
   * APIs).
   *
   * - `allow-scripts`: Allows the page to run scripts (but not create pop-up
   * windows). If this keyword is not used, this operation is not allowed.
   *
   * - `allow-storage-access-by-user-activation` (experimental): Allows
   * a document loaded in the `<iframe>` to use the
   * [Storage Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API)
   * to request access to unpartitioned cookies.
   *
   * - `allow-top-navigation`: Lets the resource navigate the top-level
   * browsing context (the one named _top).
   *
   * - `allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation`: Lets the resource navigate
   * the top-level browsing context, but only if initiated by a user gesture.
   *
   * - `allow-top-navigation-to-custom-protocols`: Allows navigations to
   * non-http protocols built into browser or registered by a website.
   * This feature is also activated by allow-popups or allow-top-navigation
   * keyword.
   *
   * > **_NOTE:_**
   * - When the embedded document has the same origin as the embedding page,
   * it is **strongly discouraged** to use both `allow-scripts` and
   * `allow-same-origin`, as that lets the embedded document remove the
   * `sandbox` attribute — making it no more secure than not using the
   * `sandbox` attribute at all.
   * - Sandboxing is useless if the attacker can display content outside
   * a sandboxed `iframe` — such as if the viewer opens the frame in a new tab.
   * Such content should be also served from a separate origin to limit
   * potential damage.
   *
   * > **_NOTE:_**
   * When redirecting the user, opening a popup window, or opening a new tab
   * from an embedded page within an `<iframe>` with the `sandbox` attribute,
   * the new browsing context is subject to the same `sandbox` restrictions.
   * This can create issues — for example, if a page embedded within an

   *
   * When providing only a single image, rather than a set of images from which
   * the browser selects the best match for the viewport size and display pixel
   * density, the `src` attribute is a string specifying the URL of the desired
   * image. This can be set either within the HTML itself using the `src`
   * content attribute, or programmatically by setting the element's `src`
   * property.
   *
   * If you use the `srcset` content attribute to provide multiple image options
   * for different display pixel densities, the URL specified by the `src`
   * attribute is used in one of two ways:
   *
   * - as a fallback for browsers that don't support `srcset`.
   * - as an equivalent for specifying an image in `srcset` with the size
   * multiplier `1x`; that is, the image specified by `src` is used on
   * low-density screens (such as typical 72 DPI or 96 DPI displays).
   *
   * Additionally, if you use `src` along with both sizes (or the corresponding
   * sizes content attribute) and `srcset` in order to choose an image based
   * on the viewport size, the `src` attribute is only used as a fallback
   * for browsers that don't support `sizes` and `srcset`; otherwise, it's
   * not used at all.

   * - **Attribute is not set (default), an empty string, or a JavaScript MIME
   * type** - Indicates that the script is a "classic script", containing
   * JavaScript code. Authors are encouraged to omit the attribute if the
   * script refers to JavaScript code rather than specify a MIME type.
   *
   * - `importmap`: This value indicates that the body of the element contains
   * an import map. The import map is a JSON object that developers can use to
   * control how the browser resolves module specifiers when importing
   * JavaScript modules.
   *
   * - `module`: This value causes the code to be treated as a JavaScript
   * module. The processing of the script contents is deferred. The `charset`
   * and `defer` attributes have no effect. Unlike classic scripts, module
   * scripts require the use of the CORS protocol for cross-origin fetching.
   *
   * - `speculationrules` (experimental): This value indicates that the body
   * of the element contains speculation rules. Speculation rules take the form
   * of a JSON object that determine what resources should be prefetched or
