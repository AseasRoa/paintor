   * `viewBox` with the smallest Y value of the viewport.
   *

   * `viewBox` with the midpoint X value of the viewport. Align the midpoint
   * Y value of the element's `viewBox` with the midpoint Y value of
   * the viewport. This is the default value.
   *
   * - `xMaxYMid`:

   * Y value of the element's `viewBox` with the midpoint Y value of the viewport.

   * Y value of the viewport.
   *
   * The following two keywords determine how the SVG should be scaled relative
   * to the container's bounds. Specifying the `meet` or `slice` reference is
   * optional and, if provided, it must be one only one of two keywords.
   * `meet` is the default value.
   *
   * - `meet`:

   * - The aspect ratio is preserved.
   * - The entire `viewBox` is visible within the viewport.
   * - The `viewBox` is scaled up as much as possible, while still meeting

   * The `display` attribute only affects the direct rendering of a given
