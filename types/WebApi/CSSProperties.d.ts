  /**
   * This property sets the distribution of space between and around content
   * items along a flexbox's cross axis, or a grid or block-level element's
   * block axis.
   *
   * - `normal`: The items are packed in their default position as if no
   * `align-content` value was set.
   *
   * - `start`: The items are packed flush to each other against the start
   * edge of the alignment container in the cross axis.
   *
   * - `center`: The items are packed flush to each other in the center
   * of the alignment container along the cross axis.
   *
   * - `end`: The items are packed flush to each other against the end
   * edge of the alignment container in the cross axis.
   *
   * - `flex-start`: The items are packed flush to each other against
   * the edge of the alignment container depending on the flex
   * container's cross-start side. This only applies to flex
   * layout items. For items that are not children of a flex
   * container, this value is treated like `start`.
   *
   * - `flex-end`: The items are packed flush to each other against
   * the edge of the alignment container depending on the flex
   * container's cross-end side. This only applies to flex
   * layout items. For items that are not children of a flex
   * container, this value is treated like `end`.
   *
   * - `baseline`, `first baseline`, `last baseline`: Specifies participation
   * in first- or last-baseline alignment: aligns the alignment baseline of
   * the box's first or last baseline set with the corresponding baseline
   * in the shared first or last baseline set of all the boxes in its
   * baseline-sharing group.
   * The fallback alignment for `first baseline` is `start`, the one for
   * `last baseline` is `end`.
   *
   * - `space-between`: The items are evenly distributed within the alignment
   * container along the cross axis. The spacing between each pair of adjacent
   * items is the same. The first item is flush with the start edge of
   * the alignment container in the cross axis, and the last item is
   * flush with the end edge of the alignment container in the cross axis.
   *
   * - `space-around`: The items are evenly distributed within the alignment
   * container along the cross axis. The spacing between each pair of adjacent
   * items is the same. The empty space before the first and after the last
   * item equals half of the space between each pair of adjacent items.
   *
   * - `space-evenly`: The items are evenly distributed within the alignment
   * container along the cross axis. The spacing between each pair of adjacent
   * items, the start edge and the first item, and the end edge and the last
   * item, are all exactly the same.
   *
   * - `stretch`: If the combined size of the items along the cross axis is
   * less than the size of the alignment container, any `auto`-sized items have
   * their size increased equally (not proportionally), while still respecting
   * the constraints imposed by `max-height`/`max-width` (or equivalent
   * functionality), so that the combined size exactly fills
   * the alignment container along the cross axis.
   *
   * - `safe`: Used alongside an alignment keyword. If the chosen keyword
   * means that the item overflows the alignment container causing data
   * loss, the item is instead aligned as if the alignment mode were `start`.
   *
   * - `unsafe`: Used alongside an alignment keyword. Regardless of
   * the relative sizes of the item and alignment container and
   * whether overflow which causes data loss might happen,
   * the given alignment value is honored.
   *
   * > **_NOTE:_**
   * The `<content-distribution>` values (`space-between`, `space-around`,

  /**
   * The CSS `align-items` property sets the `align-self` value on all direct
   * children as a group. In flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on
   * the cross axis. In grid layout, it controls the alignment of items on
   * the block axis within their grid areas.
   *
   * - `normal`: The effect of this keyword is dependent of the layout mode
   * we are in:
   *
   *   - In absolutely-positioned layouts, the keyword behaves like `start`
   *   on replaced absolutely-positioned boxes, and as `stretch` on all
   *   other absolutely-positioned boxes.
   *
   *   - In static position of absolutely-positioned layouts, the keyword
   *   behaves as `stretch`.
   *
   *   - For flex items, the keyword behaves as `stretch`.
   *
   *   - For grid items, this keyword leads to a behavior similar to the
   *   one of `stretch`, except for boxes with an aspect ratio or an intrinsic
   *   size where it behaves like `start`.
   *
   *   - The property doesn't apply to block-level boxes, and to table cells.
   *
   * - `center`: The flex items' margin boxes are centered within the line
   * on the cross-axis. If the cross-size of an item is larger than the
   * flex container, it will overflow equally in both directions.
   *
   * - `start`: The items are packed flush to each other toward the start
   * edge of the alignment container in the appropriate axis.
   *
   * - `end`: The items are packed flush to each other toward the end
   * edge of the alignment container in the appropriate axis.
   *
   * - `self-start`: The items are packed flush to the edge of the alignment
   * container's start side of the item, in the appropriate axis.
   *
   * - `self-end`: The items are packed flush to the edge of the alignment
   * container's end side of the item, in the appropriate axis.
   *
   * - `baseline`, `first baseline`, `last baseline`: All flex items are
   * aligned such that their flex container baselines align. The item
   * with the largest distance between its cross-start margin edge
   * and its baseline is flushed with the cross-start edge of the line.
   *
   * - `stretch`: If the items are smaller than the alignment container,
   * auto-sized items will be equally enlarged to fill the container,
   * respecting the items' width and height limits.
   *
   * - `anchor-center`: In the case of anchor-positioned elements,
   * aligns the items to the center of the associated anchor
   * element in the block direction. See Centering on
   * the anchor using anchor-center.
   *
   * - `safe`: Used alongside an alignment keyword. If the chosen
   * keyword means that the item overflows the alignment container
   * causing data loss, the item is instead aligned as if
   * the alignment mode were start.
   *
   * - `unsafe`: Used alongside an alignment keyword. Regardless of
   * the relative sizes of the item and alignment container and
   * whether overflow which causes data loss might happen,
   * the given alignment value is honored.
   *
   * There are also two values that were defined for flexbox,
   * as they are base on flex model axes concepts, that work
   * in grid layouts as well:
   *
   * - `flex-start`: Used in flex layout only, aligns the flex items
   * flush against the flex container's main-start or cross-start side.
   * When used outside of a flex formatting context, this value behaves
   * as `start`.
   *
   * - `flex-end`: Used in flex layout only, aligns the flex items flush
   * against the flex container's main-end or cross-end side. When used
   * outside of a flex formatting context, this value behaves as `end`.

   * Defines how SVG text content and the interior canvas of SVG shapes are
   * filled or painted. If present, it overrides the element's `fill` attribute.
   *
   * The areas inside the outline of the SVG shape or text are painted.
   * What is "inside" a shape may not always be clear. The paths defining
   * a shape may overlap. The areas considered "inside" these complex
   * shapes are clarified by the `fill-rule` property or attribute.
   *
   * If subpaths are open, `fill` closes the path before painting,
   * as if a "closepath" command were included connecting the last
   * point of the subpath with the first point of the subpath.
   * In other words, fill applies to open subpaths within `path` elements
   * (i.e., subpaths without a closepath command) and `polyline` elements.
   *
   * > **_NOTE:_**
   * The `fill` property only applies to `<circle`>, `<ellipse>`, `<path>`,
   * `<polygon>`, `<polyline>`, `<rect>`, `<text>`, `<textPath>`, `<tref>`,
   * and `<tspan>` elements nested in an `<svg>`. It doesn't apply other
   * SVG, HTML, or pseudo-elements.
