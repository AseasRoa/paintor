# What is Paintor?

Paintor is a JavaScript library for building client-side user interfaces or
HTML code.

## Key Features
- **100% JavaScript**: No transpilation. The code you write is the code to run.
- **JS Templates**: HTML-like structure (HyperScript) in JavaScript with type
  safety in the smallest detail.
- **HTML Templates**: Optional HTML syntax in JavaScript [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).
- **SSR**: The output can be HTML code for server-side rendering.
- **Reactivity**: Through [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
  and DOM events.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Render the templates in the client's
  language.
- **Type Definitions**: TypeScript type definitions for code completion and
  type safety.

# Why?

### Cults? No.

I don't like React. As a JavaScript developer, every time I was curious enough to see
and understand what React offers, I was disgusted. I couldn't stand looking at React
code for more than a few minutes. There is something in it that is not intuitive for me.
I think the learning curve of React is too steep for the problems it aims to solve. To
the point that everyone who manages to endure the learning process, eventually becomes
a cult follower. This is how I think about Angular and other over-hyped, but complex
solutions.

### "Aha" and "Wow"

I much prefer Vue or Svelte, which at the time I first stared hearing about React were
probably less popular than Angular. But when I looked at them, I quickly had this "aha"
moment, and for me Svelte even has that "wow" factor. For me, the quick "aha" and the
"wow" are very important.

### To transpile? How about No?

However, I'm not a big fan of the idea to write something in a non-native format and
transpile it on every small change in order to use it. This is usually a deal-breaker
for me.

### Vanilla

Then I was inspired by [Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/). Which to be honest,
doesn't have the "wow" factor, although it's fairly easy to understand.
And more importantly - it's vanilla. I didn't like the `m` variable, however, so I
decided to quickly write something like it by myself (as I often do).
Well, this took some years, and it's still an ongoing process.
