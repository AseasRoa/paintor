## What is Paintor?

Paintor is a JavaScript library for building client-side user interfaces or HTML code.

## Key Features
- **100% JavaScript**: No transpilation. The code you write is the code to run.
- **JS Templates**: HTML-like structure (HyperScript) in JavaScript with type safety in the smallest
  detail.
- **HTML Templates**: Optional HTML syntax in JavaScript [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).
- **SSR**: The output can be HTML code for server-side rendering.
- **Reactivity**: Through [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
  and DOM events.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Render the templates in the client's language.
- **Type Definitions**: TypeScript type definitions for code completion and type safety.
